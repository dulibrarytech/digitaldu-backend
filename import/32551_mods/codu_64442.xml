Shown are some of the eight pressers in constant daily use. Four are operated by steam and four by compressed air. The laundry was the only department of the sanatorium where patients or former patients were not employed, as the duties were too strenuous. The JCRS was a sanatorium for tuberculosis patients that was founded in 1904 by a group of immigrant Jewish workingmen along with the support of several leading physicians and rabbis in Denver, Colorado. The sanatorium was located on West Colfax Avenue just outside of Denver.</abstract><note>Title supplied by archivist.</note><note type="admin">Accession # 1271, Donated by AMC Cancer Research Center as part of the JCRS Records.</note><note type="admin">ph453</note><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Jewish Consumptives' Relief Society (U.S.)</namePart></name></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Beck Archives Photograph Collection, Health Care and Philanthropy</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><identifier type="local">B063.03.0003.00060</identifier><location><url usage="primary display">http://hdl.handle.net/10176/codu:64442</url></location><accessCondition type="useAndReproduction">Copyright restrictions may apply.
