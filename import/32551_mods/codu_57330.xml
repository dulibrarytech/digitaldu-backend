In front of them are their daughters, Bess (with a large bow), Baila, and Eleanor. A son born later is not shown in the photograph. Jacob, a schohet (a kosher slaughterer in the Jewish tradition), Talmudic scholar, and later a mohel (one who performs the ritual circumcision), migrated to Denver, Colorado, in 1914 from Russia to join his uncle, Velvel Heller. By 1917 Jacob Gordon saved enough to bring his wife and daughter Bess from Russia and the family settled on Denver's west side. Two more daughters and a son were born in Denver. Charlotte Gordon was a founder of the Beth David Sisterhood, which was organized for the purpose of building a school for Jewish education on Denver's west side. As treasurer she collected dimes and quarters for the school in the neighborhoods on the west side of Denver. The Sisterhood merged with the Denver Hebrew Institute and became the Hebrew Educational Alliance.</abstract><note>Title supplied by archivist.</note><note>Appears in ''Images of America: Jewish Denver 1859-1940,'' by Dr. Jeanne Abrams, page 106.</note><note type="admin">A copy was donated for an article by Marjorie Hornbein in the Rocky Mountain Jewish Historical Notes, Volume 4, Number 3, Spring 1982.</note><note type="admin">Photo Book #157.</note><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Gordon family</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Gorden, Jacob,--1887-1977</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Gorden, Charlotte</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Gorden, Bess</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Gorden, Baila</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Gorden, Eleanor</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Heller, Velvel</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Beth David Sisterhood (Denver, Colo.)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Hebrew Educational Alliance (Denver, Colo.)</namePart></name></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Beck Archives Photograph Collection, Families and Groups</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><identifier type="local">B063.05.0013.00016</identifier><location><url usage="primary display">http://hdl.handle.net/10176/codu:57330</url></location><accessCondition type="useAndReproduction">Copyright restrictions may apply.
