Male patients sit on folding chairs in a half circle around a male model wearing a robe, pajamas, slippers and hat. Max Lazarus, a German-Jewish artist, is pictured second from the left. Twenty-three charcoal drawings hang on the walls. The JCRS was a sanatorium for tuberculosis patients that was founded in 1904 by a group of immigrant Jewish workingmen along with the support of several leading physicians and rabbis in Denver, Colorado. It was located on West Colfax Avenue just outside of Denver.</abstract><note>Title supplied by archivist.</note><note type="admin">Donated by AMC Cancer Research Center (JCRS).</note><note type="admin">ph462</note><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Lazarus, Max,--1892-1961</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Jewish Consumptives' Relief Society (U.S.)</namePart></name></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Beck Archives Photograph Collection, Health Care and Philanthropy</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><identifier type="local">B063.03.0011.00050</identifier><location><url usage="primary display">http://hdl.handle.net/10176/codu:57299</url></location><accessCondition type="useAndReproduction">Copyright restrictions may apply.
