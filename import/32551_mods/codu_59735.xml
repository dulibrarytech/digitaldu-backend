She served as the president of the Hebrew Ladies' Benevolent Society (renamed the Jewish Relief Society in 1901) and as president of the Denver Council of Jewish Women. She also helped organize the Denver Jewish Settlement House and a free kindergarten to benefit the Eastern European Jewish immigrants on Denver's west side.  Pisko became a fund-raiser for the National Jewish Hospital for Consumptives, and in 1911 she was appointed secretary of NJH and later was named executive director as well as vice president. She was in administrative control of the day-to-day activities until her retirement in 1938.</abstract><note>Title from back of photograph.</note><note>Appears in ''Images of America: Jewish Denver 1859-1940,'' by Dr. Jeanne Abrams, page 77.</note><note type="admin">Donated by National Jewish Hospital.</note><note type="admin">ph84</note><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Pisko, Seraphine Eppstein,--1861-1942</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>National Jewish Hospital (U.S.)</namePart></name></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Beck Archives Photograph Collection, Health Care and Philanthropy</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><identifier type="local">B063.03.0011.00001</identifier><location><url usage="primary display">http://hdl.handle.net/10176/codu:59735</url></location><accessCondition type="useAndReproduction">Copyright restrictions may apply.
