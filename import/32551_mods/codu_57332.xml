It was founded in 1932 and became the largest congregation on Denver's west side. The Hebrew Educational Alliance was created as a result of the ''alliance'' between the Beth David Hebrew School Sisterhood and Brotherhood, and the Denver Hebrew Institute. On October 25, 1932, Rabbi Manuel Laderman arrived in Denver to serve as the first Rabbi of the Hebrew Educational Alliance. The combined synagogue and Hebrew School was organized along Orthodox lines. When the Alliance moved into another building, the original building became the Golden West Nursing Home.</abstract><note>Title supplied by archivist.</note><note>Courtesy of Charles McNamara.</note><note>Photograph was mislaid and was replaced by another print.</note><note>Appears in ''Images of America: Jewish Denver 1859-1940,'' by Dr. Jeanne Abrams, page 68.</note><note type="admin">Donated by the photographer, Dr. Charles Mcnamara.</note><note type="admin">ph222</note><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Laderman, Manuel,--1909-1989</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Hebrew Educational Alliance (Denver, Colo.)</namePart></name></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Beck Archives Photograph Collection, Religious Life</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><identifier type="local">B063.06.0014.00004</identifier><location><url usage="primary display">http://hdl.handle.net/10176/codu:57332</url></location><accessCondition type="useAndReproduction">Copyright restrictions may apply.
