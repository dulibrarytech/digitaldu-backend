Clara, born in 1860, was the first female Jewish baby born in Denver.  Clara's parents, Clara and Henry Goldsmith, had migrated by covered wagon from Leavenworth, Kansas.  The elder Clara died in childbirth and her daugher was named after her mother.  Clara Goldsmith Weil was raised by her aunt and uncle Rosa and Abraham Goldsmith.  The elder Clara Goldsmith's death was the impetus behind the organization of Denver's first Jewish burial society.</abstract><note>Title supplied by archivist.</note><note>Appears in ''Images of America: Jewish Denver 1859-1940,'' by Dr. Jeanne Abrams, page 15.</note><note type="admin">Donated by Dorothy Shipman.</note><note type="admin">ph1022</note><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Weil, Clara Goldsmith Bowman--1860-</namePart></name></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Beck Archives Photograph Collection, Individuals</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><identifier type="local">B063.08.0039.00004</identifier><location><url usage="primary display">http://hdl.handle.net/10176/codu:59751</url></location><accessCondition type="useAndReproduction">Copyright restrictions may apply.
