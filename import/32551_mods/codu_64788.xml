The JCRS was a sanatorium for tuberculosis patients that was founded in 1904 by a group of immigrant Jewish workingmen along with the support of several leading physicians and rabbis in Denver, Colorado. The sanatorium was located on West Colfax Avenue just outside of Denver. In the 1950s, the institution reincorporated as the American Medical Center and became one of the first dedicated cancer institutions in the nation.</abstract><note>Title supplied by archivist.</note><note type="admin">Accession # 1271, Donated by AMC Cancer Research Center as part of the JCRS Records.</note><note type="admin">ph478</note><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Chutkow, Sam</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Chutkow, Sam,--Mrs.</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Winocur, Esther--(Esther Ila)--1905-1988</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Winocur, Charles--(Charles C.)--1905-1968</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Jewish Consumptives' Relief Society (U.S.)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>American Medical Center (Denver, Colo.)</namePart></name></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Beck Archives Photograph Collection, Health Care and Philanthropy</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><identifier type="local">B063.03.0036.00012</identifier><location><url usage="primary display">http://hdl.handle.net/10176/codu:64788</url></location><accessCondition type="useAndReproduction">Copyright restrictions may apply.
