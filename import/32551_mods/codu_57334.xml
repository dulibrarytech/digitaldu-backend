A man and the matron stand on either side of the children. The Sheltering Home began as a home for the children of tuberculosis patients who came to the sanatoriums in Denver. The Denver Sheltering Home later became the National Asthma Center. The original building was destroyed by fire in 1914. The 36 children living in the home at the time were taken in by neighborhood families until a new building could be erected.</abstract><note>Title supplied by archivist.</note><note type="admin">Donated by AMC Cancer Research Center (JCRS).</note><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Denver Sheltering Home for Jewish Children</namePart></name></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><subject></subject><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Beck Archives Photograph Collection, Health Care and Philanthropy</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><identifier type="local">B063.03.0036.00002</identifier><location><url usage="primary display">http://hdl.handle.net/10176/codu:57334</url></location><accessCondition type="useAndReproduction">Copyright restrictions may apply.
