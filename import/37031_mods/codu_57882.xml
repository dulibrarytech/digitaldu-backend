This list of variables includes life cycle stage, housing tenure, racial character of the neighborhood, marital status of household head, income and numerous others. In most cases however physical site factors such as slope stability, drainage characteristics of the residential plot, ability of the soil to sustain an attractive landscape, or shrink-swell characteristics of the soil are seldom mentioned. This paper will explore the latter problem in greater detail.</abstract><subject><topic>Geography</topic></subject><subject><topic>Geology</topic></subject><location><url usage="primary display">http://hdl.handle.net/10176/codu:57882</url></location><accessCondition type="useandreproduction">Copyright restrictions may apply.
