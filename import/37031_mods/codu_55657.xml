Operational useof computers and computer products has been limited, however, because of several limitation which restricttheir use. Scientists conducting precipitation management operations need user-oriented computer products specifically designed for their needs. Several numerical models and programs have been studied and tested. A philosophy for the field use of computers has been developed. From this has grown a system for transmitting data and computer products to field users. This system has undergone a series of field tests and has been carefully evaluated. This system has been made operational by the Bureau of Reclamation, and its data and computer programs are currently available to all Project Skywater field programs.</abstract><subject><topic>Geography</topic></subject><subject><topic>Geology</topic></subject><location><url usage="primary display">http://hdl.handle.net/10176/codu:55657</url></location><accessCondition type="useandreproduction">Copyright restrictions may apply.
