Analysis of variance yielded marginally significant results when comparing flood increase factors for five precipitation groups. However, linear regression analysis indicated only 32 percent of the variation in flood factors could be explained by differences in precipitation. It was concluded that, although marginally significant differences were found between flood factors for the given precipitation groups, the difference was so slight that the results are inconclusive.</abstract><subject><topic>Geography</topic></subject><subject><topic>Geology</topic></subject><location><url usage="primary display">http://hdl.handle.net/10176/codu:57880</url></location><accessCondition type="useandreproduction">Copyright restrictions may apply.
