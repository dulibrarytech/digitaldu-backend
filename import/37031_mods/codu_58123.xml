Recent advances in GIS hardware, software, and data have opened this new technology to many smaller National Park Service units. This research, coordinated with the Intermountain Region GIS support office, provides a case study of GIS implementation and application at one such sm ll National Monument. Timpanogos Cave National Monument {TICA), Utah, requires a GIS to better serve their mission in many different areas of park management. The purpose of this research is to implement a three-dimension (3-D) capable enterprise GIS atTICA. Additionally, this research seeks to prove the capability and functionality of this GIS through a 3-D GIS rockfall hazard assessment and 3-D visualization applications.</abstract><subject><topic>Geography</topic></subject><subject><topic>Geology</topic></subject><location><url usage="primary display">http://hdl.handle.net/10176/codu:58123</url></location><accessCondition type="useandreproduction">Copyright restrictions may apply.
