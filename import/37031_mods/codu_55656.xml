Yet a comprehensive monitoring system applicable to all aspects of the environment, either natural or man-made, is far into the future. As a means of advancing the state-of-the-art for conducting environmental quality evaluations, a system is investigated in this report which has as its primary data acquisition method remote sensing techniques. Physical surrogates which represent presumed indicators of social and economic conditions of a population are utilized in the analysis. The physical surrogates employed in this investigation are correlated with social, economic, and demographic indicators identified and used by the City and County of Denver Community Renewal Program. The results are truly promising despite some procedural difficulties that occurred with the imagery interpretation phase of the study. Possibly the most pervasive or important conclusion which emerged from this study is that for remote sensing to play an important part in making environmental quality evaluations the amount and reliability of the information derived from the technique depends greatly on the background of the environment being studied. This fact is borne out in the use of architectural styling as an interpretation key for studying the morphological nature of the City and County of Denver.</abstract><subject><topic>Geology</topic></subject><subject><topic>Geography</topic></subject><location><url usage="primary display">http://hdl.handle.net/10176/codu:55656</url></location><accessCondition type="useandreproduction">Copyright restrictions may apply.
